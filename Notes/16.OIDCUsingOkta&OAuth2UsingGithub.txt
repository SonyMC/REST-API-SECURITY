	- Okta.png
	-D:\OneDrive\Study\Java\REST-API-Security\11.users-ws-okta

Note: 
	- We will not be using teh DB to get the users bit instead we will be using Okta
	- Sprign Security will eb managing all security


1)Okta Introduction:
	- Build on AWS
	- Identity Management Service
	- Provision and manage Users like employees, customers, suppliers, etc.
	- Connect users to cloud SaaS apps
	- It can streamline the user experience by connectiing users to cloud and Saas apps
	- Supports different security mechanisms like Authentication, Authorization, SSO, MFA etc.
	- Supports various industry standards like SAML, OAuth, OIDC, etc
	- Identity-Managemetn-as-a-Service(IDaaS)

2) Other competing vendors:
	- OneLogin
	- Microsoft Azure Active Directory
	- Ping Indentity
	- Duo Securitys
		

3) Creating an Account in Octa:
	- https://developer.okta.com/
		- Free account
		- Okta’s Developer Edition provides everything you need to evaluate and explore Okta for your company. Up to 100 MAU with access to most key developer features in Okta’s products for free with no time limit.
		- I have used Githib OAuth to sign-up
		- Aftetr this I have created anothr user and given 'API Access Management Administrator' role to thsi user

	- Adding a person-:
		- Directory -> People -> Add Person
		- More Actioons: 
			- Import users from CSV
			- Activate
			- Deactivate
			- Expire pwds
			- Unlock people
	- API: 
		- Security -> API


4)Registering Users API in Okta:
	- Okta -> Applications-> Applications-> Create App Integration ->
		 - Sign in Method = OIDC - OpenID Connect
		 - Application Type = Web Application 
		 - Name = users-api
		 - Logo = Optional
		 - Grant type : Client acting on behalf of a user = Authorization Code
		 - Sign-in redirect URIs = http://localhost:8082/authorization-code/callback
		  - Logout Redirect uri = http://localhost:8082
		 - Base URIs = http://localhost:8082/
		 - Assignments = Allow everyone in your organization to access 
			- Optional: If you want to restrict access, first create group and selct 'Limit access to selected groups'

		 - Note down client id and client secret:
			- Client id: 0oa546fn9qVdmB3lj5d7
			- Client secret : **** ( refer Secrets folder in local) 	

5) Change users-ws:
		- D:\OneDrive\Study\Java\REST-API-Security\11.users-ws-okta
		- POM.xml;
			- Comment dependency for jawa-jwt, mySQL, JPA
			- Add dependency for Okta

				
		- security\SecurityConfig.java:
			- Change

		- security\JwtAuthenticationFilter.java;
			- Delete
		- security\UsersDetailsServiceImpl.java
			- Delete

			- Delete
		
		- user package:
			- UserController.java 
				- New class for login api

		- application.prperties
			- Configure okta properties for issuer, client id, client secret, redirect uri 
				
			- Issuer:
				- copy the base url in the browser from the Okta user home page and append it with 'oauth2/default'
 
			- Client id:
				- Copy from home-apge of users-api in Okta 
			- Client secret:
				- Copy from home-apge of users-api in Okta 	
			- Redirect uri
				-  Copy last part of Sign-in redirect uri from home-apge of users-api in Okta 		

## Okta Related properties for OAuth2
# issuer = copy the base url in the browser from the Okta user home page and append it with 'oauth2/default'
okta.oauth2.issuer=https://dev-45554186.okta.com/oauth2/default   
okta.oauth2.client-id=0oa546fn9qVdmB3lj5d7
okta.oauth2.client-secret=i1EHil-gDpKkvG-65dU8b0vd5Ff63vQsJYtXQA6s
okta.oauth2.redirect-uri=/authorization-code/callback
		
			- Comment out mySQl and Hibernate properties 

6) Start server for users-ws:




7) Login url using browser:
			- https://localhost:8082/users/login
			- Will show not secure -> go to advanced -> contune to local host:
					- Rsponse : 400 Bad Request
			- Okta -> Applications -> Applications -> users-api -> 
			- General settings -> Edit :
						- Login -> change Sign-in and Sign-out redirect urls from http to https 
						
			- Refresh
			- Okta Login page will appear
			- Sign in with user cred ( mailsonymathew@gmail.com) 
			- Note: in case of page not loading propeorly, delete all cookies from browser and try again
			- Will return Username and authorites ( this is coded in UserController.java class)
				 UserName: 00u55y4owchfr09y45d7
		         UserAuthorities: [ROLE_USER, SCOPE_email, SCOPE_openid, SCOPE_profile]

8) User consent screen:
	- OAth 2.0 has two screens:
		- Authorization Sceen
		- Consent Screen
	- In above E.g we did not get consent screen
	- Okta -> Appliocations -> users-api :
			- Ensure User Consent section is availalbe and Check 'REquire Consent'
			- If User Consent section is not available:
				- Place a request to Okta support for enabling User Consent screen: https://support.okta.com/help/open_case?_&_ga=2.256318283.1338688018.1605059643-1267278169.1604905057
			- Now configure consent scope as describe below

9) Configure Consent Scopr Authorization server:
	- Okta -> Security -> API -> Authorization Servers -> Click on default link -> Scopes tab :
			- openid -> edit -> User Consent -> Check 'Require user consent for this scope' -> Uncheck 'Block Services for Requesting this scope'


10) Retart server for users-ws:
		- Delete cookies 
		- https://localhost:8082/users/login
		- Authorization Screen will be shoen first 
				- Enter creds( mailsonymathew@gmail.com, Ro@@@@@@)
		- Okta consent screen screen will be shown next 
				-Allow access 
				 UserName: 00u55y4owchfr09y45d7
		         UserAuthorities: [ROLE_USER, SCOPE_email, SCOPE_openid, SCOPE_profile]	


11) Note: Once consent is given it will always be associated with that user 
			- We have to delete the previous consent to see consent screen again.
				- Delete Grants: https://dev-45554186.okta.com/api/v1/users/{userId}/grants
										
				- {userId}:
					- Okta-> Directory -> People -> Click on user -> User id will be available in the end of teh url as shown below
							'https://dev-45554186-admin.okta.com/admin/user/profile/view/00u55y4owchfr09y45d7'
				- Set Header: Authorization = SSWS {{api-token}}
					- In order to get api-token:
							- Okta -> Secuirty -> API -> Authorization Servers -> tab 'Tokens' -> Create token -> name= api-token-1
									- Copy token : 00cKQzjjSgY4J_r4sFmFpH1kBJ6kDjV-g40QMaljmZ
						
					- POSTMAN:
						- Delete-Grant: DELETE: https://dev-45554186.okta.com/api/v1/users/00u55y4owchfr09y45d7/grants
									  : Request -> Headers :
									[{"key":"Authorization","value":"SSWS 00cKQzjjSgY4J_r4sFmFpH1kBJ6kDjV-g40QMaljmZ"]
									
						- Success Response: 
							- 204 : No content 
								- Note: Anything on 200 range is a successs
						
					- Go to browser:
						- Delete cookies 
						- https://localhost:8082/users/login
						- Authorization screen will be shown after enterign teh credentials wfter which we will get consent form
							- UserName: 00u55y4owchfr09y45d7
							UserAuthorities: [ROLE_USER, SCOPE_email, SCOPE_openid, SCOPE_profile]	

12)Scopes:
Configure Consent Scope Authorization server:
	- Okta -> Security -> API -> Authorization Servers -> Click on default link -> Scopes tab :
				- If required add consent for all scopes viz. openid, profile, email, address, phone, offline_access, device_sso :
						- edit -> User Consent -> Check 'Require user consent for this scope' -> Uncheck 'Block Services for Requesting this scope'
						
						
						
13)Delete consent:
							
					- POSTMAN:
						- Delete-Grant: DELETE: https://dev-45554186.okta.com/api/v1/users/00u55y4owchfr09y45d7/grants
									  : Request -> Headers :

							UserName: 00u55y4owchfr09y45d7
							UserAuthorities: [ROLE_USER, SCOPE_email, SCOPE_openid, SCOPE_profile]		

15)OpenID Connect Implementation : 	Getting Access and ID Tokens for Okta using Postman:

	- Redirect URI for Postman: https://www.getpostman.com/oauth2/callback
	- Okta -> Applications -> Applications-> users-api -> General Settings -> Edit:
			- Login -> Sign-in redirect URIS -> Add URI -> https://www.getpostman.com/oauth2/callback
	- Postman:
		- - Postman:
		- - Postman:
		- Okta-Access-ID-Token-Request  / Okta-Access-ID-Token-Request-profile : 
			- GET: 
				- Request
						- Authorization
							- Type = OAuth2.0
							- Configure new Token:
								- Token Name = okta-token-1
								- Grant type = Authorization code
								- Callback URL = https://www.getpostman.com/oauth2/callback
									- Authorize using Browser = leave unchecked
								- Auth url : https://{your-okta-domain}/oauth2/default/v1/authorize
											- okta-domain: can be foun din logged in okta url( remeber to deelte '-admin':
												- https://dev-45554186-admin.okta.com/admin/app/oidc_client/instance/0oa546fn9qVdmB3lj5d7/#tab-general
											- https://dev-45554186.okta.com/oauth2/default/v1/authorize
								- Access Token URL: https://{your-okta-domain}/oauth2/default/v1/token
											- https://dev-45554186.okta.com/oauth2/default/v1/token
									
								- Client id: Okta-> Applications ->Applications -> users-api -> Client ID =  0oa546fn9qVdmB3lj5d7
								- Client secret : Okta-> Applications ->Applications -> users-api -> Client Secret = ***** ( refer Secrets folder in local directory)
								- Scope = openid
								- State = myTestState
								- Client Authentication = Send Client credentials in Body
								- Delete consent using 'Delete-Grant' request
								- Press 'Get New Access Token'  button in 'Access-Token-Request' request which we have created now 
								- You will be presented with Okta Authentication screen 
										- Enter credentials
								- Next you will be shown Okta's consent screen with opneid label:
										- Allow acces
								- Postman will geenrate as response Access Token & ID Token( because we are uisng OPenID Connect - refer 'OpenIDConnect.png' and '15.OOPenIDConnect.txt'  :
										- Access Token
											- Token name = okta-token-1
											- Token type = Bearer
											- Expires_in = 3600
											- Scope = openid ( Note: we can give 'openid profile' if we want profile details in ID TokeN)
										- id_token
								- We can see Access Token and id_token as Postman is acting as both Front and Back Channel
								- Copy Accees Token & id_token:
										- goto jwt.io
											- decode token to see jwt details: 




16)OAuth Implementation : :Registering Users-api in GitHub:
	- Github -> Settings ->Developer Settings -> OAuth Apps -> New OAuth App 
		- Application name: users-api-2
		- Homepage url:
			- Use Postman's homepage: https://www.getpostman.com/oauth2/callback
		- Authorization callback url:
			- Use Postman's homepage: https://www.getpostman.com/oauth2/callback
		- Enable Device flow:
			- Leave unchecked 
		- Register application
		- After registering -> 	Github -> Settings ->Developer Settings -> OAuth Apps -> users-api-2:
			- Copy Client ID: fb3e42c96a00bef75e0d
			- Client secret : ****  ( refer Secrets folder in local drive)

17) OAuth Implementation : Getting Access token for Github from Postman:
	- Note: Remember Github is only OAuth2.0 provider and note OpenIDConnect Provider. Hence we will get only Access token and we will not get ID Token 
	- - Postman:
		- Github-Access-Token-Request : 
			- GET: 
				- Request
						- Authorization
							- Type = OAuth2.0
							- Configure new Token:
								- Token Name = github-token-1
								- Grant type = Authorization code
								- Callback URL = https://www.getpostman.com/oauth2/callback
									- Authorize using Browser = leave unchecked

								- Auth url : https://github.com/login/oauth/authorize
								- Access Token URL: https://github.com/login/oauth/access_token
										
									
								- Client id:Github -> Settings ->Developer Settings -> OAuth Apps -> users-api-2 -> Client ID =  fb3e42c96a00bef75e0d
								- Client secret : Settings ->Developer Settings -> OAuth Apps -> users-api-2 ->  Client Secret = ****  ( refer Secrets folder in local drive)
								- Scope = user
								- State = myTestState
								- Client Authentication = Send Client credentials in Body
								- Press 'Get New Access Token'  button in 'Access-Token-Request' request which we have created now 
								- You will be presented with Github Authentication screen 
										- Enter credentials
								- Next you will be shown Github's consent screen w
										- Allow acces
								- Postman will geenrate as response Access Token :
										- Access Token
											- Token name = github-token-1
											- Access Token : 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
											- Token type = Bearer
											- Scope = user
										
								- We can see Access Token as Postman is acting as both Front and Back Channel
								- Copy Accees Token :
										- Note: Github access token is not in jwt format

18) OUAth2 vs OIDC( Open ID Connect):
	- OIDC:
		- 2 tokens: 
			- Access Token 
		      - ID  Token
		- Token type:
			- Bearer 
		- Scope: 
			- openid
		- Token type:
			- jwt 

	- OAuth2.0:
		- 1 token: 
			- Access Token 
		- Token type:
			- Bearer 
		- Scope: 
			- user
		- Token type:
			- non-jwt

19)
	- POSTMAN: See all tokens genrated in POSTMAN:
		- Okta-Access-ID-Token-Request -> 
			- Authorization = OAuth2
			- Access Tokens = Select 'Manage Tokens' from dropdown


20) Access token vs ID Token:
	

	- Access Token 
		- Subject: email address viz. the user id
		- jti: 'AT' which is Access Token
sr 

	- ID Token:
 		- Subject: user id is encrypted if scope is 'openid', If more profile details are required use scope = 'openid profile'.
		- jti: 'ID' which is ID Token 
		- auth_time : claim for authorization time is available 
		- idp: id provider
